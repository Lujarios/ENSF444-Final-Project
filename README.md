## Introduction

Magic: The Gathering (MTG) is a trading card game with around 27,000 unique cards. Each card has at least one color associated with it, which is a key part of the game. The colors are divided into five categories: White, Blue, Black, Red, and Green. Each color has its own unique playstyle and mechanics; however, for this project, we will be focusing on the color classification of cards.

The objective of this project is to predict the color classification of MTG cards based on their oracle text (the descriptive text on the card) using a machine learning model. We will utilize a dataset containing all unique MTG cards, including their oracle text and corresponding color, to train and evaluate our model.
