    "\t\tMagic: The Gathering (MTG) is a trading card game with around 27,000 unique cards. Each card has (at least one) color associated with it, which is a key part of the game. The colors are divided into five categories: White, Blue, Black, Red, and Green. Each color has its own unique playstyle and mechanics; however, for this project, we will be focusing on the color classification of cards.\n",

We will utilize a dataset containing all unique MTG cards, including their oracle text and corresponding color, to train and evaluate our model.\n",

Scryfall is a comprehensive database of Magic: The Gathering cards, and their API provides access to a wealth of information about each card, including its name, type, color identity, and oracle text. The dataset contains over 27,000 unique cards, making it an ideal resource for our project.\n",
    "\t</p>\n",
    "\t<p>\n",
    "\t\tThe data was collected using Python and the requests library to make API calls to Scryfall. We retrieved the card data in JSON format and stored it in a CSV file for further processing. The dataset only includes the oracle text and color identity of each card, as these are the two features we will be using for our machine learning model. The oracle text is the descriptive text on the card that explains its abilities and effects, while the color identity is a list of colors associated with the card. The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to remove any unnecessary information and ensure that it was in a suitable format for analysis.\n",

    "\t<p>\n",
    "\t\tSince cards can have multiple colors, we have chosen to forgo any multi-coloured cards in our dataset. This means that we will only be using cards that are classified as mono-colored, which simplifies the classification task. This choice was made to ensure that our model focuses on the core mechanics of each color without the added complexity of multi-colored cards that can tend to blur the lines between the themes of each color.\n",
